We welcome contributions to iDeliverAPI! To ensure a smooth and efficient collaboration, please follow these guidelines when contributing.

## Conventional Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to standardize our commit messages. This helps us to automate the release process and generate changelogs.

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

The `type` can be one of the following:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- 'chore': Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

The `scope` is optional and can be anything specifying the location of the commit change.

The `description` is a short description of the change.

## Branch naming

We use the following naming convention for branches:

```
<type>/<description>
```

The `type` can be one of the following:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix

The `description` is a short description of the change.
